# brother-brscan4
Creating a container to automate my scanning from my Brother MFC-L2700DW scanner.  This will take a button press from the
scanner and send it to a scanning script. 

### Adding more soon
Code based on repository: https://github.com/rocketraman/sane-scan-pdf.git with some minor changes.
